The compound effect is the principle of reaping huge rewards from a series of small, smart choices.

1% better every day = 37x better in a year.
1% worse every day = 0.03x in a year.

The difference between success and failure is often found in the daily habits we barely notice.

Key areas where compounding works:
- Knowledge compounds
- Relationships compound
- Money compounds
- Skills compound

Start small. Stay consistent. Trust the process.
