description: "Breaking down complex problems to their fundamental truths"

First principles thinking is about boiling things down to their fundamental truths and reasoning up from there.

Instead of reasoning by analogy (this is like that), we ask: What are we absolutely sure is true? What has been proven?

This approach helps us:
- Challenge assumptions
- Find innovative solutions
- Avoid cargo cult thinking
- Build from solid foundations

Next time you face a complex problem, ask yourself: What do I know to be true? Start there.
