description: "Why sharing your journey matters more than perfection"
---

Building in public has become a powerful way to learn, grow, and connect with others. It's about sharing your process, not just your polished products.

When we build in public, we:
- Get immediate feedback
- Build accountability
- Help others learn from our mistakes
- Create authentic connections

The fear of judgment often holds us back, but vulnerability is strength. Every master was once a disaster.

Start small. Share one thing you learned today. Your journey matters more than you think.
