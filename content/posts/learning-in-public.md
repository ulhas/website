The best way to learn is to teach. The best way to teach is in public.

When you learn in public:
- You clarify your own thinking
- You get corrected when wrong
- You help others on the same journey
- You build a body of work

Don't wait until you're an expert. Document what you learn as you learn it.

Your beginner's mind is valuable. You remember what it's like not to know.

Share your notes. Write that blog post. Make that video. Your future self will thank you.
