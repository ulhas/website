Constraints aren't limitationsâ€”they're creative catalysts.

When we have infinite options, we often create nothing. When we have constraints, we're forced to be creative.

Examples of powerful constraints:
- Twitter's character limit created a new form of writing
- Haiku's structure produces profound poetry
- Startup budget constraints drive innovation

Next project: Add a constraint. Less time. Less money. Fewer features.

Watch your creativity soar.
