This is a draft post. It won't appear on the website because it has `draft: true` in its front matter.

## Why Draft Posts?

Draft posts are useful for:
- Work in progress content
- Ideas you're not ready to publish
- Testing new formats or styles

When you're ready to publish, simply change `draft: true` to `draft: false` or remove the draft line entirely.
