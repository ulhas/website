Every decision depletes your mental energy. By evening, your willpower is shot.

This is why:
- Zuckerberg wears the same shirt
- Obama had only gray and blue suits
- Jobs had his black turtleneck

Reduce decisions in the trivial to save energy for the important.

Strategies:
- Plan your week on Sunday
- Prep meals in advance
- Create morning routines
- Set decision rules

Save your mental energy for what matters.
