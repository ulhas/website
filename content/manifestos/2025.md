# Manifesto 2025: On Building and Being

This year marks another revolution around the sun, another opportunity to reflect and recalibrate.

## Looking Back

The past year taught me that complexity is often a choice, not a requirement. The most profound insights came from subtraction, not addition. I learned to:

- Say no more often than yes
- Find joy in constraints
- Value clarity over completeness
- Trust the process over the outcome

## Core Principles for the Year Ahead

### 1. Simplicity as a Practice

Not just in code or design, but in life. Every system, every relationship, every project benefits from ruthless simplification.

### 2. Deep Work Over Busy Work

Time is non-renewable. Spending it on shallow activities is a form of poverty, regardless of income.

### 3. Building in Public

Share the process, not just the results. The journey is often more valuable than the destination.

### 4. Intellectual Honesty

Question everything, especially your own beliefs. Strong opinions, loosely held.

### 5. Compound Investments

In relationships, knowledge, and systems. Small, consistent actions create extraordinary results over time.

## What I'm Building

This year is about building:
- Systems that empower rather than constrain
- Communities based on shared values
- Products that solve real problems
- A body of work that stands the test of time

## The Meta Principle

Above all, remember: We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.

Here's to another year of learning, building, and becoming.
