Two things happened recently which has chagned my views of "retiring at 45". A meeting and a podcast conversation.

Since I started working I fantasised about retiring at 45. I am not sure how this idea came in my head, but that has been the case since I received my first paycheck. The idea of doing nothing but to sit at a beach somewhere, sipping an Old Fashioned while reading a book, seems too good to pass. And I lived with this as the truth.

While this felt good, but I couldn't imagine a life where I am doing absolutely nothing. This bothered me. Something didn't feel right about not affecting any change in the world _after_ .

Now with block out of the way, I started looking at my future with much enthusiasm. Some questions which I had never asked started coming up.

1. How much time do I have to make changes?
2. What changes do I want to make?
3. Why do I want to make these changes?
4. How to do it?

Let's first talk about what drives me in my life
